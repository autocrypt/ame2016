# AME2016: Automatic Mail Encryption unconf + hackathon

It's high time we get emails end-to-end encrypted for massively more users than today.  The AME2016 meetup at the Onion Offices in Berlin is where we want to discuss how to achieve that.  The gathering is meant to be a meetup of mail client developers, crypto researchers and people involved with standardization, useability and other cross-cutting concerns.  It's an unconference meaning that everybody can just-in-time bring ideas for sessions, prototypes and whatnots.  Some people will already meet a few days earlier for hacking and prototyping.

## Dates

**hackathon/hangout starts Wednesday 14th Dec 2016.**

**unconference starts friday evening Dec 16th and goes until Dec 18th sunday afternoon.**
