# AME2016: Automatic Mail Encryption unconf + hackathon

It's high time we get emails end-to-end encrypted for massively more users than today.  The AME2016 meetup at the Onion Offices in Berlin is where we want to discuss how to achieve that.  The gathering is meant to be a meetup of mail client developers, crypto researchers and people involved with standardization, useability and other cross-cutting concerns.  It's an unconference meaning that everybody can just-in-time bring ideas for sessions, prototypes and whatnots.  Some people will already meet a few days earlier for hacking and prototyping.

## dates and location

**hackathon/hangout starts: Wednesday 14th Dec 2016.**

**unconference: Friday evening Dec 16th until Dec 18th sunday afternoon.**

We will meetup during the whole time at the [Onion office](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3237956432#map=19/52.55048/13.36968) which is located at:

    ExRotaprint-Gelaende
