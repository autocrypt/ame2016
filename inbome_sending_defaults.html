<h1>Use-Cases for Sending Emails in Convenience Mode</h1>
<h3>Terminology: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Encryption of the content: 
    <ul>
      <li>&quot;open&quot;: Content is not encrypted</li>
      <li>&quot;encrypted&quot;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Transport of the encryption preference/information (INBOME headers) 
    <ul>
      <li>&quot;enc-requested&quot;: INBOME infos are sent signaling that encryption 
        is preferred</li>
      <li> &quot;enc-agnostic&quot;: INBOME infos are not sent or are not signaling 
        that encryption is preferred</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>General rules:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Default is always open if keys are missing</li>
  <li>When sending to multiple recipients, the defaulkt is always the weakest 
    of the individual defaults</li>
</ul>
<h3>Individual rules:</h3>

    <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><b><font color="#333333">Trigger</font></b></td>

  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>send new email (start new thread)</td>
    <td>none</td>
    <td>??? (there should probably be a default depending on whether 
      we have the key)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>enc-agnostic</td>
    <td>open</td>

    <td>enc-requested</td>
    <td>encrypted</td>

    <td>open &amp; enc-agnostic</td>
    <td>open</td>

    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>open &amp; enc-requested</td>
    <td>encrypted</td>
  </tr>

    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>encrypted &amp; enc-agnostic</td>
    <td><b>encrypted !</b></td>

<h3><b>Remarks &amp; Consequences:</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>encrypted &amp; enc-agnostic might happen if 
    <ul>
      <li>emails are encrypted without using INBOME</li>
      <li>sender explicitly want to send the key but still prefers not to encrypt</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If a sender has different clients, one might send enc-requested, one might 
    send enc-agnostic (web client, not supporting INBOME yet), then there is no 
    perfect solution for always doing things right. The current approach is that 
    the default for a new email would simply depend on the header of the last 
    email, which might mean that whether encryption is used might change with 
    each message 
    <ul>
      <li>As then the default might constantly change, users might have a problem, 
        because people often hate situations that are hard to predict.</li>
      <li>At least the default must be visible and easily modifyable.</li>
      <li>Another approach might be to check the past emails (plural). E.g. if 
        one of the past emails was enc-requested, then to encrypt. But then the 
        question is how long to look back and whether users will hat that the 
        default is &quot;always&quot; wrong after giving up encryption.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The case &quot;reply to encrypted &amp; enc-agnostic =&gt; encrypted&quot; 
    is there for a couple of reasons 
    <ul>
      <li>There might be a good reason that the last mail was encrypted, so this 
        shouldn't not change without interaction/confirmation</li>
      <li>When there are multiple recipients one enc-agnostic would then result 
        into &quot;open&quot; (or the rule that we always take the weakest becomes 
        more complicated)</li>
      <li>The case that somebody lost a key, should anyway lead to a effect that 
        the recipient replaced the key, but not suddenly switched to enc-agnostic.</li>
    </ul>
